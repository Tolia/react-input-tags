# react-tagging
React component for tagging inputs.

## TODO:
### Basic
- [X] insert a tag on keydown (enter, tab, comma) or onblur, clear the input
- [X] delete a tag on keydown (backspace / delete) or onclick of button
- [X] input placeholder
- [X] input autosize while typing
  - [ ] tags should stay within container, instead of going over
  - [ ] is mirrored node always on one line? scrolling? changing browser width?
  - [ ] tags should be the same font-size / styling as input when typed
- [ ] on tab, set focus back to input
- [ ] tests

### Advanced
- [ ] list of suggestions, click one will insert as tag
- [ ] custom render of suggestion
- [ ] edit tag by clicking
- [ ] reorder tags by dragging
- [ ] drag tag from one component to another (onDrag?)
- [ ] inline styling vs classNames?
- [ ] tests
